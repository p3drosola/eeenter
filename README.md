#### Tumblr API keys
To begin, you'll need to [register a tumblr application](http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps).

create the file `config/local.js` an place your keys there. You can overwrite any of the config variables in `config/base.js` in this file. It's not checked into version control.

    module.exports = {
      CONSUMER_KEY: '89has87dhasdd9878hawd87h872387dw2'
    , CONSUMER_SECRET: '87ahsd8uhd782h3ef87h45783ghw9efj29e87fh2'
